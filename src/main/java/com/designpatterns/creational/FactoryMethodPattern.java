/*
provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects
that will be created.
This pattern promotes loose coupling by reducing the dependency of a client class on the specific classes of objects
that it needs to instantiate.

### Pros:

- **Promotes Code Reuse**: By centralizing the creation of objects in a method, it allows for code reuse and consistency in the way objects are created.

- **Loose Coupling**: Reduces the dependency of the client code on specific classes, making it easier to extend or modify without changing existing code.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The factory method pattern promotes a single responsibility for classesâ€”creating objects is centralized, and the rest of the code focuses on its main tasks.

- **Flexibility**: Allows you to introduce new products (concrete classes) without modifying the existing code.

### Cons:

- **Complexity**: Introducing a Factory Method can increase the complexity of the code as it adds more classes and interfaces to the system.

- **Overhead**: For simple applications, using a Factory Method might add unnecessary overhead and make the code harder to follow.
