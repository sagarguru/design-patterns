/*
The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
This pattern treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, meaning you can handle both single objects and composites
(objects that contain other objects) in the same way.
Pros
Simplifies Client Code: Clients can treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This means client code can be simpler, not worrying about whether it is dealing with a leaf or a composite.

Flexible Hierarchy: The Composite pattern makes it easy to add new kinds of components. You can add new Leaf or Composite classes without changing the existing code.

Hierarchical Structures: This pattern naturally represents tree structures, which is common in real-world scenarios like GUI components, file systems, etc.

Encapsulation: It encapsulates the structure and the behavior of composite objects.

Cons
Overhead: Introducing a Composite structure can add complexity to the system, especially if the system doesnâ€™t inherently require a tree structure.

Inappropriate Design for Simple Structures: If the hierarchy is simple and unlikely to change, the Composite pattern might be overkill and unnecessarily complicate the design.

Difficulties with Type Safety: Because the components in a Composite structure are treated uniformly, enforcing type constraints can be challenging, leading to potential run-time errors.

Potential for Unintended Consequences: Operations that modify the structure (like adding or removing children) might have unintended side effects, especially in large and complex structures.
